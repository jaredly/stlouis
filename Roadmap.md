# EARRINGS

- one version, where we cut outlines of the roads (can play with different road thicknesses)
- one version, where we do the same but it's neighborhoods? idk
    - ooh that might look nicely filagree

# BOX

177mm by 228mm by 51mm (7in x 9in x 2in)

LID: engraved w/ the outline of the neighborhoods

LID EMBED: 100mm/s 20% power, gives us an extra mm looks like?

Estimated time:
21 minutes
10.5 minutes
8 minutes
8 minute

47 minutes!


# CUTTING

Second sheet started, but soon into it there was a misalignment üò¨ I think because
I was start fully to the left side of the bed? Looks like I'll need to give it some
more margin ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
Starting over at like 9:35 or something.
lol this is taking forever. 10:50 and it's 55% done üôÑ.
Finished the whole sheet 2 (incl 30min of cutting) at noon.
Starting sheet 3 at 12:10.
Finished at 1:51.
Vector cut, 20%, 10mm/s 4 passes.

First sheet done!

Ugh restarted around 1pm. dang it.
70% at 2:15


OK my k40 can do
- 320mm by 200mm

I should cut 13in to 8.5in
yay I have several


Grid tests
- 16% 100mm/s
- 12% 100mm/s
- 14% 200mm/s
- 18% 200mm/s


Focusing!
2.5cm at bottom of the bottom?
2.0 terrible
2.3 still bad
2.4 maybe about as good
2.6??



Power tests:
10% power - way too light @ 200mm/s

100mm/s 10% power, decent
100mm/s 15% power, better
200mm/s 20% power
200mm/s 30%

200mm/s 20% but 0.05 step thing instead of 0.1mm
10%?

15% at 200mm/s, 0.05 step, looks cool!




OK on my material:

20% 200mm/s 0.1 gap

yeah 



How large is my thing
currently 179mm x 355mm

2 2/3 feet

32 inches by 20 inches

but I should make 

7x13 at the moment

Ok, 


6.25mm between lines

26 to the second
32.5 on the next
39 on the third?
13.5 to the top

oh ok it's a 1/4in grid
0.53 to the first line

1/2 in margin w/ holes
1/4 in margin outside


# Hm ok what about

- [ ] multi move please. selection yes
- [ ] oh ok so what about my plans and such

# FOR PUZZLE

- [x] make a compile button
- [x] do basic bounding-box filtering for a single piece
- [x] do all pieces, and explode them out from the center
- [x] allow you to manually adjust the pieces, in world-space

CUTTING LASER

- 20%, 200mm/s and 10mm/s

0.2 shrink seems ok
we might want to make the pieces larger? hmmm

but the roads need to be much darker



Ok thinking about how to bake these pieces.
Clip will be mega non-performant, not to mention meerk40t doesn't support it.
So I think I'll use skia to clip everything.
Which does mean that I'll be using a separate render method that reimplements
everything, which is something of a pain.
unless .. I .. make a 'svg to skia' thing?
that's kindof interesting actually.
oh ugh but then I'd have to parse transforms? yeah not into it.

And I could join things by color

# Editor

- [x] make a show/hide details button to improve perf
- [x] actually figure out the transform so my name offsets are in the right coordinate system
- [x] handle 'selection' of a label, so I can do rotation & scaling
- [-] have a 'show/hide hidden labels' in case I hid something by accident
- [x] clip to the city



- [ ] I think I might want to make a separate program that is "rearrange your svgs for printing"?
  - it would read in an SVG, and like, just allow you to move toplevel 'g's around?
    and rotate them probably.
    could be quite simple.
    OH but it would know how to export multiple files, for multiple cuttings if there's too much
    for your laser bed.

- need to do all the clippings, and then toss them on a canvas so you can arrange them into cuts
- figure out the right kerf for that thanks
- allow names to be rotated, and shrunk.
    - also split into two lines

- [x] hmm I don't know if I actually want residential streets ü§î


Want a BOX
- do the channels on 3 sides, with a cover that slides in
- the back channel should be a little tighter, so you get a snug fit!


Ok but I really should have my preprocessor do a "polygon inside test" and remove
all roads and such that are outside of the city.


ooh what if I had the skeleton of the outside thing, with some interesting
informative text about st louis history or something?









Ok nice, we're looking pretty good.
I've got something that I could laser on my machine,
although it would take an hour and a half

I want to do some tests


OK Laser settings:
- 15% @ 200mm/s, and 
    trunk: '#111',
    motorway: '#333',
    primary: '#555',
    secondary: '#666',
    tertiary: '#777',
    residential: '#888',

    others: '#888',
	ended up being rather too faint.
- 20% @ 200mm/s, and all black
	much better! Although I think the text might be better at the lighter (15%)?
	So once meerk40t can do clips, that would be nice.
	Although the small text is less readable at 15%.


I'll want to bring ... some example wood? to the laser? idk.





- [x] ok, but so let's only have one, and have it near the midpoints.
- [x] I need to filter out shortish roads too (just made it so I can hide things manually)




Ok, so to get this in good shape:
- put the labels in good places! making UI to move & remove them manually.
- come up with a better outline? idk.






places - names of neighborhoods!
roads  - primary is good
natural - parks!

Ok, so my basic idea is:
load up the roads ...

ok, and let's use pathkit to union all the roads together.
also, I need to turn fonts into paths.

ok, adding the text, and then making a thing around it.
